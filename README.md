I worked on a comprehensive Tableau Story built on the Sample Superstore dataset, focusing on uncovering insights. The story includes multiple dashboards analyzing regional performance, top and bottom product trends, discount impacts, category profitability, and sales over time. Advanced visualizations such as cumulative sales, discount-profit correlations, and  analysis are included to help viewers to understand and make clear decisions.Rhe tableau file consists of many sheets and two dashboards which show the clear visualizations.And the stores tell us about the operation performed on the dataset.
